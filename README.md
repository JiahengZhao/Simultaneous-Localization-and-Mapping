# Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using Lidar, Kinect RGBD measurements

# Introduction
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an extremely important algorithm in the field of robotics. It is a chicken-or-egg problem: a map is needed for localization and a pose estimate is needed for mapping. This algorithm can help robots or machines to understand the environment geometrically. This capability serves as a complementary function to the fancy deep learning applications. In this paper, I have implemented localization prediction and updating, occupancy grid mapping and texture mapping using encoders, IMU, lidar scan measurements and Kinect RGBD images.
